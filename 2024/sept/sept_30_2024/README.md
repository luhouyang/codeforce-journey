To solve the **Cards Partition** problem, we need to determine the maximum possible size of each deck (`d`) such that:

1. **Uniform Deck Size**: All decks have the same size `d`.
2. **Unique Card Types per Deck**: No two cards of the same type appear in the same deck.

Additionally, you can purchase up to `k` additional cards of any type to help achieve the optimal partitioning.

### **Understanding the Constraints**

- **Card Types (`n`)**: There are `n` distinct types of cards, each with an initial count `a_i`.
- **Coins (`k`)**: You can buy up to `k` additional cards, where each coin allows you to buy one card of any type.
- **Deck Size (`d`)**: We need to maximize `d` such that the partitioning rules are satisfied.

### **Key Observations**

1. **Deck Count (`t`)**: If each deck has size `d`, the total number of decks required is `t = ceil(total_cards / d)`, where `total_cards` is the sum of all card counts after purchasing additional cards.

2. **Type Distribution Constraint**: To ensure no two cards of the same type are in the same deck, the number of decks `t` must be at least as large as the maximum number of any single card type. Formally, `t >= max(a_i)`.

3. **Purchasing Additional Cards**: Buying additional cards can help balance the distribution, ensuring that the number of decks `t` satisfies both the total card count and the type distribution constraints.

### **Solution Approach**

The goal is to find the maximum `d` such that:

- **Condition 1**: You can distribute all cards (including up to `k` additional ones) into decks of size `d`.
- **Condition 2**: The number of decks `t` is sufficient to accommodate the most frequent card type.

Given these observations, we can approach the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate Initial Totals**:
   - Compute the total number of cards `sum = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n`.
   - Identify the maximum card count `mx = max(a_i)`.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Deck Sizes**:
   - Start checking from the largest possible deck size down to 1.
   - For each potential deck size `d`, determine the minimum number of decks `t` required:
     - **Deck Count `t`**: `t = floor((sum + k) / d)`.
     - This accounts for the maximum number of cards you can have after purchasing up to `k` additional cards.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - **Condition 1**: Ensure that `t * d >= sum`. This guarantees that all cards can fit into `t` decks.
   - **Condition 2**: Ensure that `t >= mx`. This ensures that the most frequent card type can be distributed without violating the unique type constraint per deck.

4. **Select the Maximum Feasible Deck Size**:
   - The first `d` that satisfies both conditions is the maximum feasible deck size.

### **Explanation of the Provided Code**

Let's break down the provided C++ code step by step to understand how it implements the above approach:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 2e5 + 5;
long long t, n, k, x, sum, mx;

int main()
{
    for (cin >> t; t--;)
    {
        cin >> n >> k;
        mx = sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            cin >> x, sum += x, mx = max(mx, x);
        for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--)
        {
            if ((sum + k) / i * i >= sum && (sum + k) / i >= mx)
            {
                cout << i << "\n";
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - The number of card types `n` and the number of coins `k`.
     - The array `a` representing the initial count of each card type.

2. **Calculating `sum` and `mx`**:
   - It initializes `sum` to accumulate the total number of cards and `mx` to track the maximum count among all card types.
   - For each card type, it updates `sum` and `mx`.

3. **Iterating Over Possible Deck Sizes (`d`)**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = n` down to `1`, considering each possible deck size `d = i`.
   
4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `(sum + k) / i * i >= sum`
     - `(sum + k) / i` calculates the maximum number of decks `t` you can have with deck size `d = i` after buying up to `k` additional cards.
     - Multiplying back by `i` (`* i`) gives the total number of cards that can fit into these decks.
     - The condition checks whether this total is at least the initial `sum`, ensuring that all original cards can be distributed.
   
   - **Condition 2**: `(sum + k) / i >= mx`
     - This ensures that the number of decks `t` is at least the maximum card type count `mx`, satisfying the unique type per deck constraint.

5. **Output and Termination**:
   - Once a deck size `i` satisfies both conditions, it's printed as the answer for the current test case.
   - The loop breaks, moving on to the next test case.

#### **Why This Works**

- **Maximizing Deck Size**: By iterating from the largest possible deck size (`n`) downward, the first `i` that satisfies both conditions is guaranteed to be the maximum feasible deck size.
  
- **Ensuring Feasibility**: The two conditions ensure that:
  - All cards (including possible additional ones) can fit into the decks.
  - No deck has duplicate card types.

- **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (`n` up to 2×10⁵ and `t` up to 10⁴), this approach is efficient. It processes each test case in linear time relative to `n`, ensuring that the solution runs within the time limits.

### **Illustrative Example**

Let's consider the first sample input:

```
3 1
3 2 2
```

- **Initial Counts**: `a = [3, 2, 2]`, `sum = 7`, `mx = 3`.
- **Coins Available**: `k = 1`.

**Trying `d = 3`**:
- **Deck Count `t`**: `t = floor((7 + 1) / 3) = floor(8 / 3) = 2`.
- **Check Conditions**:
  - `2 * 3 = 6 >= 7` → **False**.
  
**Trying `d = 2`**:
- **Deck Count `t`**: `t = floor((7 + 1) / 2) = floor(8 / 2) = 4`.
- **Check Conditions**:
  - `4 * 2 = 8 >= 7` → **True**.
  - `4 >= 3` → **True**.
  
Since `d = 2` satisfies both conditions, it's the maximum feasible deck size for this test case.

### **Conclusion**

The provided code efficiently determines the maximum possible deck size by iterating from the largest potential size downward and checking the feasibility based on the total number of cards and the distribution constraints. This approach ensures that all conditions are met while maximizing the deck size, effectively solving the problem within the given constraints.
