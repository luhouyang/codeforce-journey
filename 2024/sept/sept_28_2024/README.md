This C++ code solves the "Robin Hood in Town" problem using binary search to find the minimum amount of gold (`x`) that must be added to the wealth of the richest person for Robin Hood to appear. Letâ€™s break it down:

### Includes and Definitions:
1. **`#include <bits/stdc++.h>`**: Includes all the standard C++ libraries.
2. **`#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>` and `#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>`**: These are used to include the policy-based data structure from the GNU library, specifically `ordered_set`, which is used as an alternative to a sorted set. However, it's not used in this particular code.
3. **`ordered_set`**: The definition is given for `ordered_set`, but it isn't utilized here.
4. **`#define int long long`**: This defines `int` to be of type `long long` to avoid overflow, as the wealth sums and values can become very large (up to 10^16).
5. **`pb`, `in`, `sortva`, `sortvd`**: These are macros for common operations:
   - `pb`: Shortcut for `push_back` for adding elements to a vector.
   - `in`: Shortcut for `insert` to insert into a container.
   - `sortva`, `sortvd`: Shortcuts to sort a vector in ascending and descending order, respectively, though they aren't used in this code.

### Constants:
- **`MOD = 1e9 + 7`**: A common large prime modulus (not used in this code but typically used in competitive programming for modulus operations).

### Function Definitions:

#### `bool condition(int mid, vector<int> a)`:
This function checks if adding `mid` (the extra gold) to the wealth of the richest person will make strictly more than half of the population unhappy. It does this by:
1. Calculating the average wealth after adding `mid` to the total wealth.
2. Dividing the average wealth by 2 to get the threshold for "unhappiness."
3. Counting how many people have wealth less than this threshold.
4. Returning `true` if more than half of the population is unhappy, `false` otherwise.

#### `void solve()`:
This function solves the problem for a single test case:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - Reads the total number of people `n`.
   - Reads the wealth array `a` containing the wealth of each person.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are only 1 or 2 people, it's impossible for Robin Hood to appear, so the answer is `-1`.
3. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - Initializes `low = -1` and `high = 1e16` to define the search range for the minimum amount of gold `x` that can be added.
   - **Binary Search**: Repeatedly calculates the middle point `mid` and checks the `condition` function to see if adding `mid` gold makes more than half the population unhappy. Adjusts the search range based on the result.
4. **Output**: After binary search, the final value of `high` is printed, which represents the minimum amount of gold that needs to be added.

#### `int32_t main()`:
1. **Setup**: This is the main driver function of the program. It:
   - Disables synchronization between C and C++ I/O streams (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`) for faster I/O.
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls the `solve()` function `t` times to process each test case.

### Explanation of the Approach:
1. **Binary Search**: 
   - The goal is to find the minimum `x` such that after adding `x` to the wealth of the richest person, more than half of the people are unhappy (i.e., their wealth is less than half the new average wealth).
   - A binary search is performed on `x` from 0 to a large upper bound (`1e16`), adjusting based on whether adding the current `mid` amount of gold causes more than half the population to be unhappy.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For cases with only 1 or 2 people, it's impossible for Robin Hood to appear, hence the output is `-1`.

### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search**: Used to efficiently find the minimum value of `x` by halving the search space each time.
- **Average Wealth and Unhappiness**: The condition checks if adding `x` increases the number of people whose wealth is less than half of the average, triggering Robin Hood's appearance.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the test case `4 1 2 3 4`:
- Initial wealth is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The richest person (4) needs an additional `x = 15` gold to make more than half the population unhappy, i.e., have wealth less than half the new average wealth after redistribution.

Certainly! Let's walk through an example using the provided C++ code and the input list `[21, 5, 3, 10, 20, 24, 12, 16]`. We'll determine the minimum amount of gold `x` that needs to be added to the richest person to make Robin Hood appear, as per the problem statement.

### **Problem Recap:**

- **Objective:** Find the minimum `x` to add to the richest person's wealth such that **strictly more than half** of the population becomes unhappy.
  
- **Unhappy Definition:** A person is unhappy if their wealth is **strictly less than half of the average wealth** after adding `x` to the richest person.

- **Robin Hood Appears:** If more than half of the population is unhappy.

### **Given Input:**

```
n = 8
a = [21, 5, 3, 10, 20, 24, 12, 16]
```

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**

1. **Identify the Richest Person:**
   - The richest person has `24` gold.
   - We will add `x` to this person's wealth: `24 + x`.

2. **Calculate Total Wealth and Average Wealth:**
   - **Initial Total Wealth (`sum`):** `21 + 5 + 3 + 10 + 20 + 24 + 12 + 16 = 111`
   - **New Total Wealth after adding `x`:** `111 + x`
   - **Average Wealth (`ave`):** `(111 + x) / 8`
   - **Half of Average Wealth (`t`):** `(111 + x) / 16`

3. **Define Unhappiness Condition:**
   - A person is unhappy if their wealth `< t`.
   - We need **strictly more than half** of the population (i.e., at least `5` out of `8` people) to be unhappy.

4. **Determine Unhappy Individuals:**
   - Current wealth list after adding `x`: `[21, 5, 3, 10, 20, 24 + x, 12, 16]`
   - For each person, check if `a[i] < (111 + x) / 16`.

5. **Binary Search to Find Minimal `x`:**
   - **Goal:** Find the smallest `x` such that at least `5` people satisfy `a[i] < (111 + x) / 16`.
   - **Search Range:** `x` can range from `0` to a large upper bound (e.g., `1e16`), but we'll find the minimal `x` through stepwise checking.

6. **Manual Calculation to Find Minimal `x`:**

   Let's incrementally find the smallest `x` where at least `5` people are unhappy.

   - **For `x = 0`:**
     - `sum = 111 + 0 = 111`
     - `t = 111 / 16 = 6.9375`
     - **Unhappy People:** `[5, 3]` (only `2` people)
     - **Condition Not Met:** Need at least `5` unhappy.

   - **For `x = 146`:**
     - `sum = 111 + 146 = 257`
     - `t = 257 / 16 = 16.0625`
     - **Unhappy People:** `[5, 3, 10, 12, 16]` (`16` is `< 16.0625`)
     - **Total Unhappy:** `5` people
     - **Condition Met:** Exactly `5` unhappy, which is more than half (`4`).

   - **For `x = 145`:**
     - `sum = 111 + 145 = 256`
     - `t = 256 / 16 = 16`
     - **Unhappy People:** `[5, 3, 10, 12, 16]` (`16` is **not** `< 16`)
     - **Total Unhappy:** `4` people
     - **Condition Not Met:** Need at least `5` unhappy.

   - **For `x = 146`:**
     - As seen above, `5` people become unhappy.
     - **Condition Satisfied.**

   Therefore, the **minimum `x`** required is **`146`**.

7. **Final Output:**

```
146
```

### **Explanation:**

- **At `x = 146`:**
  - The richest person's wealth becomes `24 + 146 = 170`.
  - **New Total Wealth:** `257`
  - **Average Wealth:** `257 / 8 = 32.125`
  - **Half of Average Wealth:** `16.0625`
  - **Unhappy Threshold:** Any wealth `< 16.0625`
  - **Unhappy Individuals:** `[5, 3, 10, 12, 16]` (`16` is `< 16.0625`)
  - **Total Unhappy:** `5` out of `8` people (which is more than half).

- **At `x = 145`:**
  - The richest person's wealth becomes `24 + 145 = 169`.
  - **New Total Wealth:** `256`
  - **Average Wealth:** `256 / 8 = 32`
  - **Half of Average Wealth:** `16`
  - **Unhappy Threshold:** Any wealth `< 16`
  - **Unhappy Individuals:** `[5, 3, 10, 12]` (`16` is **not** `< 16`)
  - **Total Unhappy:** `4` out of `8` people (which is exactly half, not more).

Thus, `x = 146` is the smallest value that satisfies the condition.

### **Conclusion:**

For the input `[21, 5, 3, 10, 20, 24, 12, 16]`, the minimum gold `x` that needs to be added to the richest person (`24`) for Robin Hood to appear is **`146`**.
