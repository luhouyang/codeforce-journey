Great question! Understanding how sorting works in this context is crucial for grasping the overall functionality of the provided C++ code. Let's delve into **why the `sort` function is invoked as `sort(b + 1, b + m + 1)`**.

### **1. Understanding Array Indexing in the Code**

Firstly, it's important to recognize how the array `b` is being used in the code:

```cpp
int b[100005];
```

- **1-Based Indexing**: The array `b` is being populated starting from index `1` up to `m`. This means:
  - `b[1]` holds the first element.
  - `b[2]` holds the second element.
  - ...
  - `b[m]` holds the `m`-th element.

**Why 1-Based?**  
In competitive programming and some algorithmic implementations, 1-based indexing is sometimes preferred for readability or to align with problem statements that use 1-based numbering. However, C++ arrays are inherently 0-based, so the programmer consciously starts filling the array from index `1` and leaves `b[0]` unused or for other purposes.

### **2. The `sort` Function in C++**

The `sort` function in C++ is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and is used to sort elements in a range. Its signature is typically:

```cpp
template <class RandomIt>
void sort(RandomIt first, RandomIt last);
```

- **`first`**: Iterator pointing to the beginning of the range to sort (inclusive).
- **`last`**: Iterator pointing to the end of the range to sort (exclusive).

**Key Point:**  
The range `[first, last)` is a **half-open interval**, meaning it includes `first` but **excludes** `last`.

### **3. Applying `sort` to the 1-Based Array**

Given that `b` is 1-based and populated from `b[1]` to `b[m]`, here's why the sort is invoked as `sort(b + 1, b + m + 1)`:

1. **Pointer Arithmetic:**
   - `b` is a pointer to the first element of the array (`b[0]`).
   - `b + 1` points to `b[1]`.
   - `b + m + 1` points to `b[m + 1]`.

2. **Sorting the Correct Range:**
   - **Start**: `b + 1` ensures that the sort starts from `b[1]`.
   - **End**: `b + m + 1` ensures that the sort goes **up to but does not include** `b[m + 1]`.
   - Therefore, the sort covers elements `b[1]` through `b[m]` exactly.

3. **Avoiding `b[0]`:**
   - Since `b` is 1-based in usage, `b[0]` is either unused or holds irrelevant data. By starting the sort at `b + 1`, we exclude `b[0]` from being sorted.

### **4. Visual Representation**

Imagine the array `b` and the sort range:

```
Indices: 0    1    2    3    ...    m    m+1
         |    |    |    |          |      |
         b[0] b[1] b[2] b[3] ... b[m] b[m+1]
```

- **`sort(b + 1, b + m + 1)`** sorts:
  - **From**: `b[1]` (inclusive)
  - **To**: `b[m]` (since `b[m + 1]` is excluded)

### **5. Why Not Use 0-Based Sorting?**

Given that the array is used starting from index `1`, using `sort(b + 1, b + m + 1)` aligns with how the array is populated and accessed in the rest of the code. Sorting from `b[1]` to `b[m]` ensures that:

- All relevant elements are sorted.
- The unused or irrelevant `b[0]` remains untouched.
- Subsequent operations (like `upper_bound`) work correctly on the sorted 1-based segment.

### **6. Example**

Let's illustrate with a simple example:

**Suppose `m = 5` and the array `b` is populated as follows:**

```
Index: 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Value: x   7   2   9   4   5   y
```

- **Before Sorting (`b + 1` to `b + m + 1`):**
  - Elements to sort: `b[1] = 7`, `b[2] = 2`, `b[3] = 9`, `b[4] = 4`, `b[5] = 5`
  
- **After Sorting:**
  - Sorted elements: `2, 4, 5, 7, 9`
  - Array becomes:
    ```
    Index: 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    Value: x   2   4   5   7   9   y
    ```

- **`b[0]` and `b[6]` remain `x` and `y` respectively**, untouched by the sort.

### **7. Implications for the Rest of the Code**

Sorting `b[1]` to `b[m]` is essential because:

- **Binary Search Operations**: Functions like `upper_bound` rely on the data being sorted to function correctly.
  
  ```cpp
  int x = upper_bound(b + 1, b + m + 1, a) - b;
  ```
  
  - This line searches for the first element in `b[1]` to `b[m]` that is greater than `a`.
  - Accurate results depend on the array being sorted.

- **Logical Conditions**: The code checks where the query `a` falls relative to the sorted positions to determine the output.

### **8. Alternative Approaches**

If the array were 0-based, sorting could be invoked as:

```cpp
sort(b, b + m);
```

However, since the array is used from index `1`, the current approach ensures consistency and correctness.

### **9. Summary**

- **1-Based Indexing**: The array `b` is populated from `b[1]` to `b[m]`.
- **Sort Range**: `sort(b + 1, b + m + 1)` correctly sorts elements `b[1]` through `b[m]`.
- **Half-Open Interval**: `sort` in C++ sorts from the `first` iterator up to but not including the `last` iterator.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: `b + 1` and `b + m + 1` are used to define the start and end of the sort range, respectively.

By invoking `sort(b + 1, b + m + 1)`, the programmer ensures that only the relevant portion of the array is sorted, maintaining the integrity of the data structure used throughout the rest of the program.
